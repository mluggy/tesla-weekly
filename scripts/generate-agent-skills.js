// Generates listener-facing Agent Skills (https://agentskills.io) under
// /.well-known/agent-skills/. Each skill is a SKILL.md describing one
// capability an agent can perform on behalf of a listener.
//
// The index.json is the v0.2.0 discovery format: each entry carries
// `type`, `url`, and a `digest` of the form `sha256:{64-hex-lowercase}`
// over the artifact's raw bytes. Agents fetch the index, verify each
// artifact, and load instructions on demand.
//
// IMPORTANT: SKILL.md bodies use *relative* paths (e.g. `/api/search`)
// rather than {{SITE_URL}} placeholders. Relative paths keep the served
// bytes byte-stable across hostnames, so sha256 in the index matches what
// the agent fetches. The index itself does use {{SITE_URL}} for the
// `url` field; the middleware rewrites the index per-request and the
// digest doesn't depend on it.
